# CS229 Project
In this project, we built multiple machine learning models including the random forest, two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) and 3D-CNN to detect P- and S-wave arrivals in real-time from microseismic dataset. The two CNN models outperform the random forest model, and achieve high prediction accuracy. We performed sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of the models. Results demonstrate high reliability in the CNN architectures. Please refer to this [report] for more details.

Project features:
* Performed signal analysis to convert time series to appropriate time-frequency spectrograms.
*	Fine-tuned the CNN model that achieved prediction error less than 2% in more than 85% test scenarios.
